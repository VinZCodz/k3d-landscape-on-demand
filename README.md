Stop wasting time on local setup. A fully functional, multi-node cluster with a pre-configured UI in minutes. Done with your work? "throw-it-away"! Delete the codespace! Done clean, hassle free, optimized for the GitHub free tier.

## 🎨 Visual Landscape (Headlamp UI)

No squinting at ```kubectl get pods``` You have a fully integrated Headlamp UI! live.

- Access: Go to the Ports tab in your Codespace and open Port 9090.

- Secure Auth: I used secure tokens with RBAC. If your token expires or you missed it in the logs, just run:

```
kubectl create token headlamp-admin -n headlamp
```
- Features: Real-time visual cues, built-in pod exec, and cluster-wide insights, packaged offered by Headlamp UI.

- Dogfooding: I built this to host my own backend services and experiment.

- Zero Footprint: Nothing is installed on your laptop. Use it, experiment, and delete the Codespace when done. No security worries, no leftover junk.

- Fully Open: Unlike "black box" solutions, everything here is open-source and extensible via IaC.

- Helm Ready: Native support for Helm charts to deploy your apps instantly, remote!

- Work in Progress: I haven't added Nginx Load Balancer support yet, but improvements are already underway!
