_Boom! Your cluster is ready in minutes! GUI on Port 9090._

## 🎨 Visual Landscape (Headlamp UI)

- UI is ready! Just goto the ```Ports``` tab and click ```Open in Browser 🌐``` at Port 9090. (Refresh browser to configure and load)
- UI should ask for Login token! Find them at ```.cluster-token.txt``` in root.
  
## 🚀 Deploy your "Hello World" App in 30 Seconds inside cluster!

- Deploy the Demo App from examples ```kubectl apply -f examples/all-in-one.yaml```
- Check Running pods ```kubectl get pods``` 
- Head to Port 8080 via Ports tab.

The default cluster name is ```vinzcodz-cluster``` 

Use these to manage your environment:

- Stop Cluster: ```k3d cluster stop vinzcodz-cluster```

- Start Cluster: ```k3d cluster start vinzcodz-cluster```

- If your token expires or you missed it, just run:

```
kubectl create token headlamp-admin -n headlamp --duration=24h > .cluster-token.txt
cat .cluster-token.txt
```
